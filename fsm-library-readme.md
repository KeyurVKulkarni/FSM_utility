# FSM Library

## Overview

FSM Library is a utility tool developed in C for abstracting and simplifying the creation, maintenance, and scheduling of Finite State Machines (FSMs) in embedded systems, particularly in Firmware projects.

## Problem Statement

In many embedded codebases, the pattern of creating FSM processes is commonly found for governing repetitive execution of functions, especially in embedded Firmware projects. This library aims to abstract this pattern, providing efficient APIs to handle all aspects (control & data) of the FSM.

## Features

- Simplifies the process of creating, maintaining, and scheduling FSMs
- Provides definite functions for smooth FSM operation
- Developer-friendly design allowing for architecture-specific tweaks
- Efficient control and data handling through provided APIs

## Language

C

## Current Status

This library has not been completely developed, so it is not ready to be used.
But thats the best part, because I have plenty of room for suggestions !
Feel free to reach out to me for incorporating errors / bugs / changes / additions, etc. so that they can be planned in further releases!

**Note:** This library has not yet been fully tested or integrated on any production Firmware project.

## Installation

Intended for offline use.
Download the library and place it in your project folder.
Make sure to include 'api_fsmUtility.h' in your project for utilizing all kinds of features of this library.
